# Python-Simulation
# readme file for simulation of Condo and apartment maintenance schedule
# the simulation will include regular maintenance schedules as well as failure points
# of condo or apartment building utilities and facilities
# For the reporting portion, you can use linux reports, or crystal or powerBI in ms
# PowerBI datasets or sql server or xls data gets a 'gateway' and the 
# Reports are built on the main screen canvas (desktop version of PowerBI) 
Carbon neutral buildings
Fluid dynamics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, centralized plumbing, hydro, fan coils
# as you look down the list hvac and fan coils unit appear many times.  If the fan seizes up it causes climate control problems
# in the summer if the blower stops, the coils stay cold and condensation drips down to the catch pan
# typically the basin is not clogged and should purge excess water, but there could also be leaks in the basin itself
# kitchen faucets that wear out can also cause (slow) leak problems from the counter-top to under the counter shelf
# to the floor below, also causing stains to the ceiling below
# other issues include climate comfort.  Some older apartments have baseboard oil heating.  The heat radiated could cause 
# excessive heat in the winter months.  Some apartments do not have air conditioning in the summer
Mould moisture liabilities
Cyber security in PropTech
Legal issues with tenants or superintendent
Reserve Fund issues
Water damage - fan coil, toilet, kitchen
Leasing challenges during pandemic
Deferred repairs, or replacement: roofing
Post Pandemic world
Who is the condo's appointed CFO, legal
Mechanical and electrical life expectancy and replacement for energy efficiency benefits
Enbridge time of use savings
Parking garages oil leak, water and road salts damage, proper ventilation underground, Parking P3, three-tiered underground challenges
Other items to simulate: the overall flow of waste, recycle, disposal items to incinerate for energy production.
Going forward there would be a Circular Economy and more items and customers latching on the recycling and reusing or repurposing
Several Property Management companies in the GTA are listed on the 4Rent monthly magazine
